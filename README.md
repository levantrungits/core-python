# Topic
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability. 
It’s a dynamically typed and garbage-collected language that supports structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
It’s often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. 
In this path you will learn the basics of Python and more advanced topics such as object-oriented design and code organization.
